# [424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You are given a string <code>s</code> and an integer <code>k</code>. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most <code>k</code> times.</p>

<p>Return <em>the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;ABAB&quot;, k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Replace the two &#39;A&#39;s with two &#39;B&#39;s or vice versa.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;AABABBA&quot;, k = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Replace the one &#39;A&#39; in the middle with &#39;B&#39; and form &quot;AABBBBA&quot;.
The substring &quot;BBBB&quot; has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>s</code> consists of only uppercase English letters.</li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= k &lt;= s.length</code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Two Pointers

We use a hash table `cnt` to count the occurrence of each character in the string, and two pointers `l` and `r` to maintain a sliding window, such that the size of the window minus the count of the most frequent character does not exceed $k$.

We iterate through the string, updating the right boundary `r` of the window each time, updating the count of characters within the window, and updating the maximum count `mx` of the characters that have appeared. When the size of the window minus `mx` is greater than $k$, we need to shrink the left boundary `l` of the window, updating the count of characters within the window, until the size of the window minus `mx` is no longer greater than $k$.

Finally, the answer is $n - l$, where $n$ is the length of the string.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(|\Sigma|)$. Where $n$ is the length of the string, and $|\Sigma|$ is the size of the character set. In this problem, the character set is uppercase English letters, so $|\Sigma| = 26$.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        count = defaultdict(int)
        left = 0
        maxCount = 0
        result = 1
        for right in range(len(s)):
            count[s[right]] += 1
            maxCount = max(maxCount, count[s[right]])
            if right - left + 1 - maxCount > k:
                count[s[left]] -= 1
                left += 1
            result = max(result, right - left + 1)
        return result
```

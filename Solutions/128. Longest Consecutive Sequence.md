## 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
### Question
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

```
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```
### With Map

```python
class Solution:
   def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
       d = defaultdict(int)
       m = 0
       for n in nums:
           if d[n] != 0:
               continue
           left = d[n-1]
           right = d[n+1]
           res = left + right + 1
           d[n] = res
           m = max(m, res)
           d[n - left] = res
           d[n + right]= res
       return m
```
### With Set
``` python     
class Solution:
   def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
   nums = set(nums)
   best = 0
   for x in nums:  #We are iterating over the set instead of original list
       if x - 1 not in nums: # Elements in set is always sorted
           y = x + 1
           while y in nums:
               y += 1
           best = max(best, y - x)
   return best 
```

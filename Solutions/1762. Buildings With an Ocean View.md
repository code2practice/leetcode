# [1762. Buildings With an Ocean View ðŸ”’](https://leetcode.com/problems/buildings-with-an-ocean-view)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>There are <code>n</code> buildings in a line. You are given an integer array <code>heights</code> of size <code>n</code> that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.</p>

<p>The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a <strong>smaller</strong> height.</p>

<p>Return a list of indices <strong>(0-indexed)</strong> of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> heights = [4,2,3,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> [0,2,3]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> heights = [4,3,2,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> [0,1,2,3]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> All the buildings have an ocean view.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> heights = [1,3,2,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> [3]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Only building 3 has an ocean view.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= heights.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= heights[i] &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>
</ul>

```python
class Solution:
   def findBuildings(self, heights: List[int]) -> List[int]:
       ans = []
       mx = 0
       for i in range(len(heights) - 1, -1, -1):
           if heights[i] > mx:
               ans.append(i)
               mx = heights[i]
       return ans[::-1]
```

## Meta variant
 What if you had to return all of the buildings that either have an ocean view to its left and/or its right? This becomes very similar to Leetcode 42 Trapping Rain Water
```python3
def findBuildingViewCount_second_variant_1762(heights):
    n = len(heights)
    if n == 1:
        return [0]

    left = 1
    right = n - 2
    left_view = [0]
    right_view = [n-1]
    left_max = heights[0]
    right_max = heights[n-1]
    while left <= right:
        if left_max < right_max:
            if heights[left] > left_max:
                left_view.append(left)
                left_max = heights[left]
            left += 1
            
        else:
            if heights[right] > right_max:
                right_view.append(right)
                right_max = heights[right]
            right -=1 
            
    left_view.extend(right_view[::-1])
    return left_view

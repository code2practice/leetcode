# [921. Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-add-to-make-parentheses-valid/description/)
Medium
```
A parentheses string is valid if and only if:
It is the empty string,
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.
You are given a parentheses string s. In one move, you can insert a parenthesis at any position of the string.
For example, if s = "()))", you can insert an opening parenthesis to be "(()))" or a closing parenthesis to be "())))".
Return the minimum number of moves required to make s valid.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "())"
Output: 1
Example 2:
Input: s = "((("
Output: 3
 
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s[i] is either '(' or ')'.
```

### Without Stack Solution Time O(N) Space O(1)
What if you had to return the parentheses string itself after the minimum adds?
```python
class Solution:
    def minAddToMakeValid(self, s: str) -> int:
        closeNeeded = 0
        openNeeded = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == "(":
                closeNeeded += 1
            else:
                if closeNeeded > 0:
                    closeNeeded -= 1
                else:
                    openNeeded += 1
        return closeNeeded + openNeeded
```

### With Stack Time O(N) and space O(N)

```python
class Solution:
    def minAddToMakeValid(self, s: str) -> int:
        st = []
        for c in s:
            if c == "(":
                st.append(c)
            else:
                if st and st[-1] == "(":
                    st.pop()
                else:
                    st.append(c)
        return len(st)
```

## META variant
What if you had to return the parentheses string itself after the minimum adds?
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumAddToMakeValid(self, s: str) -> str:
        result = []
        extra_opens = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == '(':
                extra_opens += 1
            elif c == ')':
                if extra_opens == 0:
                    result.append("(")
                else:
                    extra_opens -= 1
            result.append(c)

        
        result += [')'] * extra_opens
        return "".join(result)
```

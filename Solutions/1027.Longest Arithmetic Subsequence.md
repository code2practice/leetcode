# [1027. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Given an array <code>nums</code> of integers, return <em>the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in</em> <code>nums</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A <strong>subsequence</strong> is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.</li>
	<li>A sequence <code>seq</code> is arithmetic if <code>seq[i + 1] - seq[i]</code> are all the same value (for <code>0 &lt;= i &lt; seq.length - 1</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [3,6,9,12]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation: </strong> The whole array is an arithmetic sequence with steps of length = 3.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [9,4,7,2,10]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation: </strong> The longest arithmetic subsequence is [4,7,10].
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [20,1,15,3,10,5,8]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation: </strong> The longest arithmetic subsequence is [20,15,10,5].
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>2 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 500</code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Dynamic Programming

We define $f[i][j]$ as the maximum length of the arithmetic sequence ending with $nums[i]$ and having a common difference of $j$. Initially, $f[i][j]=1$, that is, each element itself is an arithmetic sequence of length $1$.

> Since the common difference may be negative, and the maximum difference is $500$, we can uniformly add $500$ to the common difference, so the range of the common difference becomes $[0, 1000]$.

Considering $f[i]$, we can enumerate the previous element $nums[k]$ of $nums[i]$, then the common difference $j=nums[i]-nums[k]+500$, at this time $f[i][j]=\max(f[i][j], f[k][j]+1)$, then we update the answer $ans=\max(ans, f[i][j])$.

Finally, return the answer.

> If initially $f[i][j]=0$, then we need to add $1$ to the answer when returning the answer.

The time complexity is $O(n \times (d + n))$, and the space complexity is $O(n \times d)$. Where $n$ and $d$ are the length of the array $nums$ and the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array $nums$, respectively.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def longestArithSeqLength(self, A):
        if len(A) < 3:
            return len(A)
        d = [defaultdict(int) for _ in range(len(A))]
        longest = 2
        for i, n in enumerate(A):
            for j in range(i):
                curr_diff = n - A[j]
                if d[j][curr_diff] > 0:
                    d[i][curr_diff] = d[j][curr_diff] + 1
                    if d[i][curr_diff] > longest:
                        longest = d[i][curr_diff]
                else:
                    d[i][curr_diff] = 2
        return longest
```

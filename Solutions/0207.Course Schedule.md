# [207. Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>There are a total of <code>numCourses</code> courses you have to take, labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>numCourses - 1</code>. You are given an array <code>prerequisites</code> where <code>prerequisites[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that you <strong>must</strong> take course <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> first if you want to take course <code>a<sub>i</sub></code>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>For example, the pair <code>[0, 1]</code>, indicates that to take course <code>0</code> you have to first take course <code>1</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return <code>true</code> if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
<strong>Output:</strong> true
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
<strong>Output:</strong> false
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= numCourses &lt;= 2000</code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= prerequisites.length &lt;= 5000</code></li>
	<li><code>prerequisites[i].length == 2</code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> &lt; numCourses</code></li>
	<li>All the pairs prerequisites[i] are <strong>unique</strong>.</li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Topological Sorting

For this problem, we can consider the courses as nodes in a graph, and prerequisites as edges in the graph. Thus, we can transform this problem into determining whether there is a cycle in the directed graph.

Specifically, we can use the idea of topological sorting. For each node with an in-degree of $0$, we reduce the in-degree of its out-degree nodes by $1$, until all nodes have been traversed.

If all nodes have been traversed, it means there is no cycle in the graph, and we can complete all courses; otherwise, we cannot complete all courses.

The time complexity is $O(n + m)$, and the space complexity is $O(n + m)$. Here, $n$ and $m$ are the number of courses and prerequisites respectively.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, pre: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        d_count = defaultdict(int)
        dep = defaultdict(list)
        for p in pre:
            dep[p[1]].append(p[0])
            d_count[p[0]] += 1
        q = deque([i for i in range(numCourses) if not d_count[i]])
        success = 0
        while q:
            top = q.popleft()
            success += 1
            for t in dep[top]:
                d_count[t] -= 1
                if not d_count[t]:
                    q.append(t)
        return success == numCourses
```

# [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs)

[中文文档](/solution/0000-0099/0070.Climbing%20Stairs/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You are climbing a staircase. It takes <code>n</code> steps to reach the top.</p>

<p>Each time you can either climb <code>1</code> or <code>2</code> steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 45</code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Recursion

We define $f[i]$ to represent the number of ways to climb to the $i$-th step, then $f[i]$ can be transferred from $f[i - 1]$ and $f[i - 2]$, that is:

$$
f[i] = f[i - 1] + f[i - 2]
$$

The initial conditions are $f[0] = 1$ and $f[1] = 1$, that is, the number of ways to climb to the 0th step is 1, and the number of ways to climb to the 1st step is also 1.

The answer is $f[n]$.

Since $f[i]$ is only related to $f[i - 1]$ and $f[i - 2]$, we can use two variables $a$ and $b$ to maintain the current number of ways, reducing the space complexity to $O(1)$.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(1)$.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(n):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
```

# [122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You are given an integer array <code>prices</code> where <code>prices[i]</code> is the price of a given stock on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day.</p>

<p>On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold <strong>at most one</strong> share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the <strong>same day</strong>.</p>

<p>Find and return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> profit you can achieve</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 7
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= prices.length &lt;= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= prices[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Greedy Algorithm

Starting from the second day, if the stock price is higher than the previous day, buy on the previous day and sell on the current day to make a profit. If the stock price is lower than the previous day, do not buy or sell. In other words, buy and sell on all rising trading days, and do not trade on all falling trading days. The final profit will be the maximum.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the `prices` array. The space complexity is $O(1)$.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        currentMinimum, profit = float("inf"), 0
        for price in prices:
            if price < currentMinimum:
                currentMinimum = price
            else:
                profit += price - currentMinimum
                currentMinimum = price
        return profit
```

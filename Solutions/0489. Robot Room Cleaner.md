# [489. Robot Room Cleaner ðŸ”’](https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-room-cleaner)

## Description

<p>You are controlling a robot that is located somewhere in a room. The room is modeled as an <code>m x n</code> binary grid where <code>0</code> represents a wall and <code>1</code> represents an empty slot.</p>

<p>The robot starts at an unknown location in the room that is guaranteed to be empty, and you do not have access to the grid, but you can move the robot using the given API <code>Robot</code>.</p>

<p>You are tasked to use the robot to clean the entire room (i.e., clean every empty cell in the room). The robot with the four given APIs can move forward, turn left, or turn right. Each turn is <code>90</code> degrees.</p>

<p>When the robot tries to move into a wall cell, its bumper sensor detects the obstacle, and it stays on the current cell.</p>

<p>Design an algorithm to clean the entire room using the following APIs:</p>

<pre>
interface Robot {
  // returns true if next cell is open and robot moves into the cell.
  // returns false if next cell is obstacle and robot stays on the current cell.
  boolean move();

  // Robot will stay on the same cell after calling turnLeft/turnRight.
  // Each turn will be 90 degrees.
  void turnLeft();
  void turnRight();

  // Clean the current cell.
  void clean();
}
</pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that the initial direction of the robot will be facing up. You can assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by a wall.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Custom testing:</strong></p>

<p>The input is only given to initialize the room and the robot&#39;s position internally. You must solve this problem &quot;blindfolded&quot;. In other words, you must control the robot using only the four mentioned APIs without knowing the room layout and the initial robot&#39;s position.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> room = [[1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],[1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]], row = 1, col = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> Robot cleaned all rooms.
<strong>Explanation:</strong> All grids in the room are marked by either 0 or 1.
0 means the cell is blocked, while 1 means the cell is accessible.
The robot initially starts at the position of row=1, col=3.
From the top left corner, its position is one row below and three columns right.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> room = [[1]], row = 0, col = 0
<strong>Output:</strong> Robot cleaned all rooms.
</pre>

	<li><code>m == room.length</code></li>
	<li><code>n == room[i].length</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= m &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 200</code></li>

	<li><code>0 &lt;= row &lt;&nbsp;m</code></li>

### Time and Space Complexity
The time complexity of the above code is O(4^(N-M)), where N is the total number of cells in the room and M is the number of obstacles. This is because the algorithm has to visit each non-obstacle cell once and at each cell, it makes up to 4 decisions â€“ move in 4 possible directions. The recursion may go up to 4 branches at each level but would not revisit cells that are already visited, summarized by visited set vis.  
The space complexity of the DFS is O(N) for the recursive call stack as well as the space to hold the set of visited cells (in the worst case where there are no obstacles and we can move to every cell). However, in a densely packed room with obstructions, the number of visited states will be less than N.

### Meta Variant
```
class Mouse {

	/**
	* Moves to one of the directions (left, right, up, down) and returns false if you can't move and true if you can.
	*/
	public boolean move(Direction direction);

	/**
	* Returns true if there is a cheese in the current cell.
	*/
	public boolean hasCheese();

	/**
	* Should return true and leave the mouse at that location or false if we can't find cheese and return the mouse back to where it started.
	*/
	public boolean getCheese() {
		// your code goes here
	}
}
```

```python3
class Mouse:
    def __init__(self):
        self.visited = set()

    def dfs(self, r, c, last_direction):
        if self.hasCheese():
            return True

        if (r, c) not in self.visited:
            self.visited.add((r, c))
            if self.move("up") and self.dfs(r - 1, c, 'up'):
                return True
            if self.move("down") and self.dfs(r + 1, c, 'down'):
                return True
            if self.move("left") and self.dfs(r, c - 1, 'left'):
                return True
            if self.move("right") and self.dfs(r, c + 1, 'right'):
                return True

        # Found nothing, go back
        if last_direction != None:
            if last_direction == "up":

1312. Minimum Insertion Steps to Make a String Palindrome
Hard
Given a string s. In one step you can insert any character at any index of the string.
Return the minimum number of steps to make s palindrome.
A Palindrome String is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "zzazz"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string "zzazz" is already palindrome we do not need any insertions.
Example 2:
Input: s = "mbadm"
Output: 2
Explanation: String can be "mbdadbm" or "mdbabdm".
Example 3:
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 5
Explanation: Inserting 5 characters the string becomes "leetcodocteel".
 
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of lowercase English letters.
```

### Approach
```
Reverse the input string to get a new string reversed_s.
Initialize a 2D array dp of size (n+1)x(n+1) with 0s, where n is the length of the input string s.
Iterate through all pairs of indices (i,j) of the array dp, where 1<=i,j<=n.
If the characters at indices i-1 in string s and j-1 in reversed_s are equal, set dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1.
Otherwise, set dp[i][j] to the maximum of dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1].
The length of the LCS between s and reversed_s is dp[n][n].
The minimum number of insertions required to make s a palindrome is n - dp[n][n]
Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string s. This is because we are filling up a 2D array of size (n+1)x(n+1) using dynamic programming approach.
Space complexity:
O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string s. This is because we are using a 2D array of size (n+1)x(n+1) to store the LCS of substrings.
```

```python
class Solution(object):
   def minInsertions(self, s):
       # reverse the input string
       reversed_s = s[::-1]
       # get the length of the input string
       n = len(s)
       # create a 2D array to store the LCS of substrings
       dp = [[0 for j in range(n+1)] for i in range(n+1)]
      
       # fill up the dp array using dynamic programming approach
       for i in range(1, n+1):
           for j in range(1, n+1):
               if s[i-1] == reversed_s[j-1]:
                   # if characters match, add 1 to LCS
                   dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
               else:
                   # otherwise, take maximum LCS of two substrings
                   dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
      
       # return the minimum number of insertions required to make s a palindrome
       # this is the difference between the length of s and the length of its LCS
       return n - dp[n][n]
```

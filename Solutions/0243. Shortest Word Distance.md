# 243. Shortest Word Distance
```
Given an array of strings wordsDict and two different strings that already exist in the array word1 and word2,
return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.
 
Example 1:
Input: wordsDict = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"], word1 = "coding", word2 = "practice"
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: wordsDict = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"], word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1
 
Constraints:
2 <= wordsDict.length <= 3 * 104
1 <= wordsDict[i].length <= 10
wordsDict[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
word1 and word2 are in wordsDict.
word1 != word2
```
### Solution

```
It is enough to traverse the array once, initialize the two variables p1, p2 to -1, and then traverse the array.
When word 1 is encountered, its position is stored in p1, and if word 2 is encountered,
its position is stored in p2. If p1, p2 are not -1 anymore, then update the result.
```

```python
class Solution:
   def shortestDistance(self, wordsDict: List[str], word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
       # Initialize indices for the positions of word1 and word2
       index1 = index2 = -1
       # Initialize the answer as infinite to ensure any actual distance found is smaller
       shortest_distance = float('inf')
    
       # Loop through the words in the dictionary to find the closest distance
       for index, word in enumerate(wordsDict):
           if word == word1:
               index1 = index  # Update the position of word1
           if word == word2:
               index2 = index  # Update the position of word2
            
           # If both words have been found at least once, calculate the distance
           if index1 != -1 and index2 != -1:
               distance = abs(index1 - index2)  # Compute absolute difference
               shortest_distance = min(shortest_distance, distance)  # Update the shortest distance
    
       # Return the shortest distance found between the two words
       return shortest_distance
```

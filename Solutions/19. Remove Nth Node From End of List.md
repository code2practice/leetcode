# [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list)

### Question:
Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

```
Example:

Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```

```python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        fast, slow = head, head
        for _ in range(n):
            fast = fast.next
        if not fast:
            return head.next
        while fast.next:
            fast, slow = fast.next, slow.next
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return head
```
#### Check if list size is less than n

```python

def RemoveFromEnd(head, n):
    fast = head
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if fast:
            fast = fast.next
        else:
            print(f"List size less than {n}")
            return head
        i += 1
    slow = head
    if not fast:
        return head.next
    while fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
    slow.next = slow.next.next
    return head
```

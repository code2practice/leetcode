# [1268. Search Suggestions System](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-suggestions-system)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You are given an array of strings <code>products</code> and a string <code>searchWord</code>.</p>

<p>Design a system that suggests at most three product names from <code>products</code> after each character of <code>searchWord</code> is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with <code>searchWord</code>. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.</p>

<p>Return <em>a list of lists of the suggested products after each character of </em><code>searchWord</code><em> is typed</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> products = [&quot;mobile&quot;,&quot;mouse&quot;,&quot;moneypot&quot;,&quot;monitor&quot;,&quot;mousepad&quot;], searchWord = &quot;mouse&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> [[&quot;mobile&quot;,&quot;moneypot&quot;,&quot;monitor&quot;],[&quot;mobile&quot;,&quot;moneypot&quot;,&quot;monitor&quot;],[&quot;mouse&quot;,&quot;mousepad&quot;],[&quot;mouse&quot;,&quot;mousepad&quot;],[&quot;mouse&quot;,&quot;mousepad&quot;]]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> products sorted lexicographically = [&quot;mobile&quot;,&quot;moneypot&quot;,&quot;monitor&quot;,&quot;mouse&quot;,&quot;mousepad&quot;].
After typing m and mo all products match and we show user [&quot;mobile&quot;,&quot;moneypot&quot;,&quot;monitor&quot;].
After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests [&quot;mouse&quot;,&quot;mousepad&quot;].
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> products = [&quot;havana&quot;], searchWord = &quot;havana&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> [[&quot;havana&quot;],[&quot;havana&quot;],[&quot;havana&quot;],[&quot;havana&quot;],[&quot;havana&quot;],[&quot;havana&quot;]]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The only word &quot;havana&quot; will be always suggested while typing the search word.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= products.length &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= products[i].length &lt;= 3000</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= sum(products[i].length) &lt;= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li>All the strings of <code>products</code> are <strong>unique</strong>.</li>
	<li><code>products[i]</code> consists of lowercase English letters.</li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= searchWord.length &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>searchWord</code> consists of lowercase English letters.</li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Sorting + Trie

The problem requires that after each letter of the input `searchWord`, recommend up to three products from the `products` array that have the same prefix as `searchWord`. If there are more than three products with the same prefix that can be recommended, return the three with the smallest lexicographic order.

To find products with the same prefix, we can use a trie; to return the three products with the smallest lexicographic order, we can first sort the `products` array, and then store the indices of the sorted array in the trie.

Each node of the trie maintains the following information:

-   `children`: This is an array of length $26$, used to store the child nodes of the current node. `children[i]` represents the node whose character is `i + 'a'` among the child nodes of the current node.
-   `v`: This is an array, used to store the indices of the characters in the `products` array among the child nodes of the current node, storing up to three indices.

During the search, we start from the root node of the trie, find the index array corresponding to each prefix, and store it in the result array. Finally, we only need to map each index in the index array to the `products` array.

The time complexity is $O(L \times \log n + m)$, and the space complexity is $O(L)$. Where $L$ is the sum of the lengths of all strings in the `products` array, and $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of the `products` array and `searchWord`, respectively.

#### Python3

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = collections.defaultdict(TrieNode)
        self.suggestion = []

    def add_sugestion(self, product):
        if len(self.suggestion) < 3:
            self.suggestion.append(product)


class Solution:
    def suggestedProducts(
        self, products: List[str], searchWord: str
    ) -> List[List[str]]:

        products = sorted(products)
        root = TrieNode()
        for p in products:
            node = root
            for char in p:
                node = node.children[char]
                node.add_sugestion(p)

        result, node = [], root
        for char in searchWord:
            node = node.children[char]
            result.append(node.suggestion)
        return result
```

### Sorting with binary Search
```
In a sorted list of words,
for any word A[i],
all its sugested words must following this word in the list.

For example, if A[i] is a prefix of A[j],
A[i] must be the prefix of A[i + 1], A[i + 2], ..., A[j]

Explanation
With this observation,
we can binary search the position of each prefix of search word,
and check if the next 3 words is a valid suggestion.


Complexity
Time O(NlogN) for sorting
Space O(logN) for quick sort.

Time O(logN) for each query
Space O(query) for each query
where I take word operation as O(1)
```

```python3
# ref: https://leetcode.com/problems/search-suggestions-system/discuss/436674/C++JavaPython-Sort-and-Binary-Search-the-Prefix
# approach 1: sort then binary search
# 1. sort input array
# 2. use binary search to find first index
# 3. check the following 3 words
# time: O(nlogn) ---> python timsort
# space: O(n) ---> might need to scan the entire input array


class Solution:
    def suggestedProducts(self, products, searchWord):
        products.sort()  # time O(nlogn)
        array_len = len(products)
        ans = []
        input_char = ""

        for chr in searchWord:
            tmp = []
            input_char += chr
            insertion_index = self.binary_search(
                products, input_char
            )  # find where input_char can be inserted in-order in the products array
            for word_ind in range(
                insertion_index, min(array_len, insertion_index + 3)
            ):  # check the following 3 words, if valid
                if products[word_ind].startswith(input_char):
                    tmp.append(products[word_ind])
            ans.append(tmp)
        return ans

    def binary_search(self, array, target):  # bisect.bisect_left implementation
        lo = 0
        hi = len(array)

        while lo < hi:
            mid = (lo + hi) // 2
            if array[mid] < target:
                lo = mid + 1
            else:
                hi = mid
        return lo
```

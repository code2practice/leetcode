## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Given an array <code>arr</code> of positive integers sorted in a <strong>strictly increasing order</strong>, and an integer <code>k</code>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the</em> <code>k<sup>th</sup></code> <em><strong>positive</strong> integer that is <strong>missing</strong> from this array.</em></p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
<strong>Output:</strong> 9
<strong>Explanation: </strong>The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;missing positive integer is 9.

## Solutions

### Solution 1

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### O(n+k) time complexity

```python
class Solution:
    def findKthPositive(self, arr, k):
        arr_set = set(arr)
        for i in range(1, k + len(arr) + 1):
            if i not in arr_set:
                k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                return i
```

#### Binary Search O(logN)
```
Now, we have two good indicators, that we need to use binary search: sorted data and O(log n) complexity.
Let us look for the following example for more understanding:
2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 12 and k = 5.
We need to find place, of k-th missing positive number, so, let us create virtual list
(virtual, because we will not compute it full, but only elements we need):
B = [2 - 1, 3 - 2, 4 - 3, 7 - 4, 11 - 5, 12 - 6] = [1, 1, 1, 3, 6, 6].
What this list represents is how many missing numbers we have for each inex: for first number we have missing number [1],
for next two iterations also, when we add 7, we have 3 missing numbers: [1, 5, 6], when we add 11,
we have 6 missing numbers: [1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]. How we evalaute values of list B? Very easy, it is just A[i] - i - 1.
What we need to find now in array B: first element, which is greater or equal than k.
In our example, we have [1, 1, 1, 3, 6, 6]. We will find it with binary search:
this element have index end = 4. Finally, we need to go back to original data, we have
arr = [2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 12]
 B = [1, 1, 1, 3, 6, 6]
So, what we now know that our answer is between numbers 7 and 11 and it is equal to arr[end] - (B[end] - k + 1),
where the second part is how many steps we need to make backward. Using B[end] = arr[end] - end - 1,
we have end + k, we need to return.
Complexity: time complexity is O(log n), space is O(1).
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findKthPositive(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        if arr[0] > k:
            return k
        left, right = 0, len(arr)
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) >> 1
            if arr[mid] - mid - 1 >= k:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return arr[left - 1] + k - (arr[left - 1] - (left - 1) - 1)
```

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Design and implement a data structure for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_frequently_used" target="_blank">Least Frequently Used (LFU)</a> cache.</p>

<p>Implement the <code>LFUCache</code> class:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>LFUCache(int capacity)</code> Initializes the object with the <code>capacity</code> of the data structure.</li>
	<li><code>int get(int key)</code> Gets the value of the <code>key</code> if the <code>key</code> exists in the cache. Otherwise, returns <code>-1</code>.</li>
	<li><code>void put(int key, int value)</code> Update the value of the <code>key</code> if present, or inserts the <code>key</code> if not already present. When the cache reaches its <code>capacity</code>, it should invalidate and remove the <strong>least frequently used</strong> key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a <strong>tie</strong> (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the <strong>least recently used</strong> <code>key</code> would be invalidated.</li>
</ul>

<p>To determine the least frequently used key, a <strong>use counter</strong> is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest <strong>use counter</strong> is the least frequently used key.</p>

<p>When a key is first inserted into the cache, its <strong>use counter</strong> is set to <code>1</code> (due to the <code>put</code> operation). The <strong>use counter</strong> for a key in the cache is incremented either a <code>get</code> or <code>put</code> operation is called on it.</p>

<p>The functions&nbsp;<code data-stringify-type="code">get</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code data-stringify-type="code">put</code>&nbsp;must each run in <code>O(1)</code> average time complexity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input</strong>
[&quot;LFUCache&quot;, &quot;put&quot;, &quot;put&quot;, &quot;get&quot;, &quot;put&quot;, &quot;get&quot;, &quot;get&quot;, &quot;put&quot;, &quot;get&quot;, &quot;get&quot;, &quot;get&quot;]
[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [3], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]
<strong>Output</strong>
[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, 3, null, -1, 3, 4]

<strong>Explanation</strong>
// cnt(x) = the use counter for key x
// cache=[] will show the last used order for tiebreakers (leftmost element is  most recent)
LFUCache lfu = new LFUCache(2);
lfu.put(1, 1);   // cache=[1,_], cnt(1)=1
lfu.put(2, 2);   // cache=[2,1], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=1
lfu.get(1);      // return 1
                 // cache=[1,2], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=2
lfu.put(3, 3);   // 2 is the LFU key because cnt(2)=1 is the smallest, invalidate 2.
&nbsp;                // cache=[3,1], cnt(3)=1, cnt(1)=2
lfu.get(2);      // return -1 (not found)
lfu.get(3);      // return 3
                 // cache=[3,1], cnt(3)=2, cnt(1)=2
lfu.put(4, 4);   // Both 1 and 3 have the same cnt, but 1 is LRU, invalidate 1.
                 // cache=[4,3], cnt(4)=1, cnt(3)=2
lfu.get(1);      // return -1 (not found)
lfu.get(3);      // return 3
                 // cache=[3,4], cnt(4)=1, cnt(3)=3
lfu.get(4);      // return 4
                 // cache=[4,3], cnt(4)=2, cnt(3)=3

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= capacity&nbsp;&lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= key &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= value &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>

### Solution
What is my data structure?
1. A Doubly linked Node
class Node:
	+ key: int
	+ value: int
	+ freq: int
	+ prev: Node
	+ next: Node
2. A Doubly Linked List
Note: This part could be replaced by OrderedDict, I implemented it by hand for clarity
class DLinkedList:
	- sentinel: Node
	+ size: int
	+ append(node: Node) -> None
	+ pop(node: Node) -> Node
3. Our LFUCache
class LFUCache:
	- node: dict[key: int, node: Node]
	- freq: dict[freq: int, lst: DlinkedList]
	- minfreq: int
	+ get(key: int) -> int
	+ put(key: int, value: int) -> None

Explanation \
Each key is mapping to the corresponding node (self._node), where we can retrieve the node in O(1) time.  \
Each frequency freq is mapped to a Doubly Linked List (self._freq), where all nodes in the DLinkedList have the same frequency, freq. Moreover, each node will be always inserted in the head (indicating most recently used).  
A minimum frequency self._minfreq is maintained to keep track of the minimum frequency of across all nodes in this cache, such that the DLinkedList with the min frequency can always be retrieved in O(1) time.  
Here is how the algorithm works  
get(key)  
query the node by calling self._node[key]  
find the frequency by checking node.freq, assigned as f, and query the DLinkedList that this node is in, through calling self._freq[f]  
pop this node  
update node's frequence, append the node to the new DLinkedList with frequency f+1  
if the DLinkedList is empty and self._minfreq == f, update self._minfreq to f+1.  
return node.val  
put(key, value)  
If key is already in cache, do the same thing as get(key), and update node.val as value  
Otherwise:  
if the cache is full, pop the least frequenly used element (*)  
add new node to self._node  
add new node to self._freq[1]  
reset self._minfreq to 1  
(*) The least frequently used element is the tail element in the DLinkedList with frequency self._minfreq  

```python
import collections


class Node:
    def __init__(self, key, val):
        self.key = key
        self.val = val
        self.freq = 1
        self.prev = self.next = None


class DLinkedList:
    """An implementation of doubly linked list.

    Two APIs provided:

    append(node): append the node to the head of the linked list.
    pop(node=None): remove the referenced node.
                    If None is given, remove the one from tail, which is the least recently used.

    Both operation, apparently, are in O(1) complexity.

        Three things to maintain:

        1. a dict, named as `self._node`, for the reference of all nodes given key.
           That is, O(1) time to retrieve node given a key.

        2. Each frequency has a doubly linked list, store in `self._freq`, where key
           is the frequency, and value is an object of `DLinkedList`

        3. The min frequency through all nodes. We can maintain this in O(1) time, taking
           advantage of the fact that the frequency can only increment by 1. Use the following
           two rules:

           Rule 1: Whenever we see the size of the DLinkedList of current min frequency is 0,
                   the min frequency must increment by 1.

           Rule 2: Whenever put in a new (key, value), the min frequency must 1 (the new node)

        This is a helper function that used in the following two cases:

            1. when `get(key)` is called; and
            2. when `put(key, value)` is called and the key exists.

        The common point of these two cases is that:

            1. no new node comes in, and
            2. the node is visited one more times -> node.freq changed ->
               thus the place of this node will change

        The logic of this function is:

            1. pop the node from the old DLinkedList (with freq `f`)
            2. append the node to new DLinkedList (with freq `f+1`)
            3. if old DlinkedList has size 0 and self._minfreq is `f`,
               update self._minfreq to `f+1`

        If `key` already exists in self._node, we do the same operations as `get`, except

        1. if the cache reaches its capacity, pop the least frequently used item. (*)
        2. add new node to self._node
        3. add new node to the DLinkedList with frequency 1
        4. reset self._minfreq to 1

        (*) How to pop the least frequently used item? Two facts:

        1. we maintain the self._minfreq, the minimum possible frequency in cache.
        2. All cache with the same frequency are stored as a DLinkedList, with
           recently used order (Always append at head)

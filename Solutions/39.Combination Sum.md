# [39. Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum)


## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Given an array of <strong>distinct</strong> integers <code>candidates</code> and a target integer <code>target</code>, return <em>a list of all <strong>unique combinations</strong> of </em><code>candidates</code><em> where the chosen numbers sum to </em><code>target</code><em>.</em> You may return the combinations in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>same</strong> number may be chosen from <code>candidates</code> an <strong>unlimited number of times</strong>. Two combinations are unique if the <span data-keyword="frequency-array">frequency</span> of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.</p>

<p>The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to <code>target</code> is less than <code>150</code> combinations for the given input.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
<strong>Output:</strong> [[2,2,3],[7]]
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
<strong>Output:</strong> [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> candidates = [2], target = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> []
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= candidates.length &lt;= 30</code></li>
	<li><code>2 &lt;= candidates[i] &lt;= 40</code></li>
	<li>All elements of <code>candidates</code> are <strong>distinct</strong>.</li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= target &lt;= 40</code></li>
</ul>

```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not candidates:
            return candidates
        result = []
        def helper(index, current, target):
            if target == 0:
                result.append(current.copy())
                return
            if target < 0 or index >= len(candidates):
                return
            helper(index, current + [candidates[index]], target - candidates[index])
            helper(index + 1, current, target)
        helper(0, [], target)
        return result
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the given code primarily depends on the number of potential combinations that can be 
formed with the given candidates array that sum up to the target. Considering the array has a length n and the 
recursion involves iterating over candidates and including/excluding them, we get a recursion tree with a depth 
that could potentially go up to target/min(candidates), if we keep using the smallest element. This leads to 
an exponential number of possibilities. Thus, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(2^n) in the worst case, 
when the recursion tree is fully developed. However, since we often return early when s < candidates[i], this 
is an upper bound.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of the algorithm is also important to consider. It is mainly used by recursion stack space and the 
space to store combinations. The maximum depth of the recursion could be target/min(candidates) which would at most be 
O(target) if 1 is in the candidates. However, the space required for the list t, which is used to store the current 
combination, is also dependent on the target and could at most have target elements when 1 is in the candidates. The 
space for ans depends on the number of combinations found. Since it's hard to give an exact number without knowing the 
specifics of candidates and target, we consider it for the upper bound space complexity. Thus, as the list ans grows with 
each combination found, in the worst case, it could store a combination for every possible subset of candidates, leading 
to a space complexity of O(2^n * target), where 2^n is the number of combinations and target is the maximum size of any
combination.
However, if we look at the auxiliary space excluding the space taken by the output (which is the space ans takes), 
then the space complexity is O(target) due to the depth of the recursive call stack and the temporary list t.

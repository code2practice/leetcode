# [865. Smallest Subtree with all the Deepest Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subtree-with-all-the-deepest-nodes)

[中文文档](/solution/0800-0899/0865.Smallest%20Subtree%20with%20all%20the%20Deepest%20Nodes/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Given the <code>root</code> of a binary tree, the depth of each node is <strong>the shortest distance to the root</strong>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the smallest subtree</em> such that it contains <strong>all the deepest nodes</strong> in the original tree.</p>

<p>A node is called <strong>the deepest</strong> if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree.</p>

<p>The <strong>subtree</strong> of a node is a tree consisting of that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> [2,7,4]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest nodes of the tree.
Notice that nodes 5, 3 and 2 contain the deepest nodes in the tree but node 2 is the smallest subtree among them, so we return it.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [1]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The root is the deepest node in the tree.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [0,1,3,null,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> [2]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The deepest node in the tree is 2, the valid subtrees are the subtrees of nodes 2, 1 and 0 but the subtree of node 2 is the smallest.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range <code>[1, 500]</code>.</li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 500</code></li>
	<li>The values of the nodes in the tree are <strong>unique</strong>.</li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Recursion

We design a function $\textit{dfs}(\textit{root})$ that returns the smallest subtree containing all the deepest nodes in the subtree rooted at $\textit{root}$, as well as the depth of the subtree rooted at $\textit{root}$.

The execution process of the function $\textit{dfs}(\textit{root})$ is as follows:

-   If $\textit{root}$ is null, return $\text{null}$ and $0$.
-   Otherwise, recursively calculate the smallest subtree and depth of the left and right subtrees of $\textit{root}$, denoted as $l$ and $l_d$, and $r$ and $r_d$, respectively. If $l_d > r_d$, then the smallest subtree containing all the deepest nodes in the subtree rooted at the left child of $\textit{root}$ is $l$, with a depth of $l_d + 1$. If $l_d < r_d$, then the smallest subtree containing all the deepest nodes in the subtree rooted at the right child of $\textit{root}$ is $r$, with a depth of $r_d + 1$. If $l_d = r_d$, then $\textit{root}$ is the smallest subtree containing all the deepest nodes, with a depth of $l_d + 1$.

Finally, return the first element of the result of $\textit{dfs}(\textit{root})$.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Here, $n$ is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def subtreeWithAllDeepest(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:

        def deepestDepth(node, depth):

            if not node:
                return node, depth

            left, leftDepth = deepestDepth(node.left, depth + 1)
            right, rightDepth = deepestDepth(node.right, depth + 1)

            # If the deepest node on the left subtree is deeper than the deepest node
            # on the right subtree return the left subtree and the left deepest depth
            if leftDepth > rightDepth:
                return left, leftDepth

            # If the deepest node on the right subtree is deeper than the deepest node
            # on the left subtree return the right subtree and the right deepest depth
            if rightDepth > leftDepth:
                return right, rightDepth

            # If the above two conditions isn't met, then leftDepth == rightDepth
            #
            # leftDepth equal rightDepth means that the deepest node
            # in the left subtree has the same depth as the deepest node
            # in the right subtree, as such, we should return the current node
            # as it is the root of the current subtree that contains the deepest
            # nodes on the left and right subtree.
            #
            # return statment can also be `return node, rightDepth`
            return node, leftDepth

        return deepestDepth(root, 0)[0]
```


### Another solution
```python
class Solution:
    def subtreeWithAllDeepest(self, root):
        def deep(root):
            if not root:
                return 0, None
            l, r = deep(root.left), deep(root.right)
            if l[0] > r[0]:
                return l[0] + 1, l[1]
            elif l[0] < r[0]:
                return r[0] + 1, r[1]
            else:
                return l[0] + 1, root

        return deep(root)[1]
```

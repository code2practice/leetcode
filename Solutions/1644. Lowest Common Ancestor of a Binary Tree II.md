## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Given the <code>root</code> of a binary tree, return <em>the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes, </em><code>p</code><em> and </em><code>q</code>. If either node <code>p</code> or <code>q</code> <strong>does not exist</strong> in the tree, return <code>null</code>. All values of the nodes in the tree are <strong>unique</strong>.</p>

<p>According to the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor" target="_blank">definition of LCA on Wikipedia</a></strong>: &quot;The lowest common ancestor of two nodes <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> in a binary tree <code>T</code> is the lowest node that has both <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> as <strong>descendants</strong> (where we allow <b>a node to be a descendant of itself</b>)&quot;. A <strong>descendant</strong> of a node <code>x</code> is a node <code>y</code> that is on the path from node <code>x</code> to some leaf node.</p>

<strong>Follow up:</strong>&nbsp;Can you find the LCA traversing the tree, without checking nodes existence?

### Solution
This problem is similar to problem #236, with the difference that node p and node q are not always in the binary tree.  
First do depth first search on the binary tree to find the nodes p and q. If either node does not exist, return null.  
If both p and q are in the binary tree, then do depth first search again to find the lowest common ancestor.  
Follow up: Can you find the LCA traversing the tree, without checking nodes existence?  
DFS. If both nodes are in the tree, refer to problem 236-Lowest-Common-Ancestor-of-a-Binary-Tree.  
During DFS, if the root is equal to p or q, it cannot immediately return the root like in problem 236-Lowest-Common-Ancestor-of-a-Binary-Tree because we cannot determine if the other node is in the tree. Therefore, our solution is to adopt post-order traversal to ensure that each node is visited. The logic is then the same as when both nodes are in the tree. Additionally, when we encounter p or q during the search, we keep a count. Finally, if the count equals 2, it means that both nodes have been found and we can return the answer.  
Algorithm for followup  
The solution uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal to go through each node in the binary tree and check for the presence of nodes p and q. To do this, we define a helper function dfs within the lowestCommonAncestor method.  
Here is a breakdown of how the dfs function works:  
The function takes three arguments: root, p, and q, where root is the current node of the tree that we are exploring.  
It begins with a base case that checks if the root is None, meaning we have reached the end of a path without finding a node. If this is the case, it returns False.  
Left Recursion: Recursively call dfs for the left child of the current node (root.left).  
Right Recursion: Recursively call dfs for the right child of the current node (root.right).  
These recursive calls will do a post-order traversal of the tree. After these calls, we have three pieces of information:  
l: Whether node p or q has been found in the left subtree.  
r: Whether node p or q has been found in the right subtree.  
The value of the current node.  
Using this information, we can detect the LCA:  
If l and r are both True, it implies that p is found in one subtree and q in the other, making the current node their LCA, so we set ans to root.  
If one of l or r is True and the current node's value matches p or q, the current node is the LCA - this happens when one is a descendant of the other.  
After the visit to each node, we return a boolean to indicate if either p or q has been found in the current subtree or if the current node is p or q. This boolean is the OR of:  
l (result from the left subtree),  
r (result from the right subtree), and  
a check whether the current root matches either p or q.  
Finally, lowestCommonAncestor initializes a variable ans to None, which is used to store the LCA. We declare ans as nonlocal inside dfs so that it can be modified within the nested function. The dfs function is then called with the original root, p, and q. The ans is returned as the final result of the lowestCommonAncestor method. If p and q are both present in the tree, ans will be their lowest common ancestor; if either is not present, ans will remain None.  
This approach efficiently utilizes the single pass post-order DFS traversal to not just search for p and q but also to identify the LCA without any additional storage or multiple passes through the tree.  

```python
class Solution:
   def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
       # This variable will hold the lowest common ancestor once it is found.
       self.ancestor = None
       def dfs(current_node):
           """
           Perform a depth-first search to find the lowest common ancestor.
        
           Args:
           current_node (TreeNode): The current node being visited.
        
           Returns:
           bool: True if the current node is ancestor or is a subtree containing p or q.
           """
           if current_node is None:
               return False
        
           # Search left subtree for p or q
           left = dfs(current_node.left)
        
           # Search right subtree for p or q
           right = dfs(current_node.right)
        
           # Check if current node is either p or q
           mid = current_node == p or current_node == q
        
           # If any two of the three flags left, right, mid are True, current_node is an ancestor
           if mid + left + right >= 2:
               self.ancestor = current_node
        
           # Return True if the current node is p, q, or if p or q is in the subtree rooted at current_node
           return mid or left or right
       # Call dfs to initiate the depth-first search
       dfs(root)
    
       return self.ancestor

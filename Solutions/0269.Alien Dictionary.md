# [269. Alien Dictionary ðŸ”’](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary)

## Description

<p>There is a new alien language that uses the English alphabet. However, the order of the letters is unknown to you.</p>

<p>You are given a list of strings <code>words</code> from the alien language&#39;s dictionary. Now it is claimed that the strings in <code>words</code> are <span data-keyword="lexicographically-smaller-string-alien"><strong>sorted lexicographically</strong></span> by the rules of this new language.</p>

<p>If this claim is incorrect, and the given arrangement of string in&nbsp;<code>words</code>&nbsp;cannot correspond to any order of letters,&nbsp;return&nbsp;<code>&quot;&quot;.</code></p>

<p>Otherwise, return <em>a string of the unique letters in the new alien language sorted in <strong>lexicographically increasing order</strong> by the new language&#39;s rules</em><em>. </em>If there are multiple solutions, return<em> <strong>any of them</strong></em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> words = [&quot;wrt&quot;,&quot;wrf&quot;,&quot;er&quot;,&quot;ett&quot;,&quot;rftt&quot;]
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;wertf&quot;
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> words = [&quot;z&quot;,&quot;x&quot;]
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;zx&quot;
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> words = [&quot;z&quot;,&quot;x&quot;,&quot;z&quot;]
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;&quot;
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The order is invalid, so return <code>&quot;&quot;</code>.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= words.length &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= words[i].length &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>words[i]</code> consists of only lowercase English letters.</li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1
```

Algorithm
It is actually a problem of directed graph traversal.
The solution consists of two steps:
Create the graph and indegree map:
For each character in the words, initialize its indegree to 0.
For each adjacent pair of words, find the first character that is different.
If the second character is not already in the adjacency list of the first character, add it and increment its indegree by 1.
Stop processing the current pair of words and move on to the next pair.
If all characters of the first word match the second word and the first word is longer than the second,
it means that the order of characters is invalid, so return an empty string.
Topological sort
Add all characters with an indegree of 0 to the queue.
For each character in the queue, add it to the result and decrement the indegree of its neighbors.
If the indegree of a neighbor becomes 0, add it to the queue.
If the length of the result equals the length of the indegree map, return the result as a string. Otherwise, return an empty string.
```


#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def alienOrder(self, words: List[str]) -> str:
        graph = defaultdict(set)
        inDegree = defaultdict(int)
        self._buildGraph(graph, words, inDegree)
        return self._topology(graph, inDegree)

    def _buildGraph(
        self, graph: Dict[str, Set[str]], words: List[str], inDegree: Dict[str, int]
    ) -> None:
        # Create a node for each character in each word
        for word in words:
            for c in word:
                inDegree[c] = 0  # necessary for final char counting
        for first, second in zip(words, words[1:]):
            length = min(len(first), len(second))
            for j in range(length):
                u = first[j]
                v = second[j]
                if u != v:
                    if v not in graph[u]:
                        graph[u].add(v)
                        inDegree[v] += 1
                    break  # Later characters' order is meaningless
                if j == length - 1 and len(first) > len(second):
                    # If 'ab' comes before 'a', it's an invalid order
                    graph.clear()
                    return

    def _topology(self, graph: Dict[str, Set[str]], inDegree: Dict[str, int]) -> str:
        result = ""
        q = deque([c for c in inDegree if inDegree[c] == 0])
        while q:
            u = q.popleft()
            result += u
            for v in graph[u]:
                inDegree[v] -= 1
                if inDegree[v] == 0:
                    q.append(v)
        # If there are remaining characters in inDegree, it means there's a cycle
        if any(inDegree.values()):
            return ""
        # Words = ['z', 'x', 'y', 'x']
        return result if len(result) == len(indegree) else ""

# [2008. Maximum Earnings From Taxi](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-earnings-from-taxi)


## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>There are <code>n</code> points on a road you are driving your taxi on. The <code>n</code> points on the road are labeled from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code> in the direction you are going, and you want to drive from point <code>1</code> to point <code>n</code> to make money by picking up passengers. You cannot change the direction of the taxi.</p>

<p>The passengers are represented by a <strong>0-indexed</strong> 2D integer array <code>rides</code>, where <code>rides[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>, tip<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> passenger requesting a ride from point <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> to point <code>end<sub>i</sub></code> who is willing to give a <code>tip<sub>i</sub></code> dollar tip.</p>

<p>For<strong> each </strong>passenger <code>i</code> you pick up, you <strong>earn</strong> <code>end<sub>i</sub> - start<sub>i</sub> + tip<sub>i</sub></code> dollars. You may only drive <b>at most one </b>passenger at a time.</p>

<p>Given <code>n</code> and <code>rides</code>, return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of dollars you can earn by picking up the passengers optimally.</em></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may drop off a passenger and pick up a different passenger at the same point.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 5, rides = [<u>[2,5,4]</u>,[1,5,1]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 7
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We can pick up passenger 0 to earn 5 - 2 + 4 = 7 dollars.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 20, rides = [[1,6,1],<u>[3,10,2]</u>,<u>[10,12,3]</u>,[11,12,2],[12,15,2],<u>[13,18,1]</u>]
<strong>Output:</strong> 20
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We will pick up the following passengers:
- Drive passenger 1 from point 3 to point 10 for a profit of 10 - 3 + 2 = 9 dollars.
- Drive passenger 2 from point 10 to point 12 for a profit of 12 - 10 + 3 = 5 dollars.
- Drive passenger 5 from point 13 to point 18 for a profit of 18 - 13 + 1 = 6 dollars.
We earn 9 + 5 + 6 = 20 dollars in total.</pre>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Memoization Search + Binary Search

First, we sort $rides$ in ascending order by $start$. Then we design a function $dfs(i)$, which represents the maximum tip that can be obtained from accepting orders starting from the $i$-th passenger. The answer is $dfs(0)$.

The calculation process of the function $dfs(i)$ is as follows:

For the $i$-th passenger, we can choose to accept or not to accept the order. If we don't accept the order, the maximum tip that can be obtained is $dfs(i + 1)$. If we accept the order, we can use binary search to find the first passenger encountered after the drop-off point of the $i$-th passenger, denoted as $j$. The maximum tip that can be obtained is $dfs(j) + end_i - start_i + tip_i$. Take the larger of the two. That is:

$$
dfs(i) = \max(dfs(i + 1), dfs(j) + end_i - start_i + tip_i)
$$

Where $j$ is the smallest index that satisfies $start_j \ge end_i$, which can be obtained by binary search.

In this process, we can use memoization search to save the answer of each state to avoid repeated calculations.

The time complexity is $O(m \times \log m)$, and the space complexity is $O(m)$. Here, $m$ is the length of $rides$.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def maxTaxiEarnings(self, n: int, rides: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rides.sort()
        starts = [x[0] for x in rides]
        n = len(rides)

        @cache
        def bsearch(target, start):
            left = start
            right = len(starts)
            while left < right:
                mid = (left + right) // 2
                if starts[mid] < target:
                    left = mid + 1
                else:
                    right = mid
            return left

        @cache
        def dfs(index):
            if index >= len(rides):
                return 0
            start, end, tip = rides[index]
            next_start = bsearch(end, index + 1)
            return max(dfs(index + 1), dfs(next_start) + (end - start + tip))

        return dfs(0)
```

### Solution 2: Dynamic Programming + Binary Search

We can change the memoization search in Solution 1 to dynamic programming.

First, sort $rides$, this time we sort by $end$ in ascending order. Then define $f[i]$, which represents the maximum tip that can be obtained from the first $i$ passengers. Initially, $f[0] = 0$, and the answer is $f[m]$.

For the $i$-th passenger, we can choose to accept or not to accept the order. If we don't accept the order, the maximum tip that can be obtained is $f[i-1]$. If we accept the order, we can use binary search to find the last passenger whose drop-off point is not greater than $start_i$ before the $i$-th passenger gets on the car, denoted as $j$. The maximum tip that can be obtained is $f[j] + end_i - start_i + tip_i$. Take the larger of the two. That is:

$$
f[i] = \max(f[i - 1], f[j] + end_i - start_i + tip_i)
$$

Where $j$ is the largest index that satisfies $end_j \le start_i$, which can be obtained by binary search.

The time complexity is $O(m \times \log m)$, and the space complexity is $O(m)$. Here, $m$ is the length of $rides$.

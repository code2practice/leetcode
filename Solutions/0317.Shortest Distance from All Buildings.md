# [317. Shortest Distance from All Buildings ðŸ”’](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-from-all-buildings)

[ä¸­æ–‡æ–‡æ¡£](/solution/0300-0399/0317.Shortest%20Distance%20from%20All%20Buildings/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You are given an <code>m x n</code> grid <code>grid</code> of values <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>2</code>, where:</p>

<ul>
	<li>each <code>0</code> marks <strong>an empty land</strong> that you can pass by freely,</li>
	<li>each <code>1</code> marks <strong>a building</strong> that you cannot pass through, and</li>
	<li>each <code>2</code> marks <strong>an obstacle</strong> that you cannot pass through.</li>
</ul>

<p>You want to build a house on an empty land that reaches all buildings in the <strong>shortest total travel</strong> distance. You can only move up, down, left, and right.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>shortest travel distance</strong> for such a house</em>. If it is not possible to build such a house according to the above rules, return <code>-1</code>.</p>

<p>The <strong>total travel distance</strong> is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.</p>

<p>The distance is calculated using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry" target="_blank">Manhattan Distance</a>, where <code>distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|</code>.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 7
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2).
The point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal.
So return 7.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[1,0]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[1]]
<strong>Output:</strong> -1
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>m == grid.length</code></li>
	<li><code>n == grid[i].length</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 50</code></li>
	<li><code>grid[i][j]</code> is either <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>2</code>.</li>
	<li>There will be <strong>at least one</strong> building in the <code>grid</code>.</li>
</ul>

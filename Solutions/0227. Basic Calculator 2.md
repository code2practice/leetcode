### 227. Basic Calculator II
Medium
```
Given a string s which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value. 
The integer division should truncate toward zero.
You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the 
range of [-231, 231 - 1].
Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, 
such as eval().
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "3+2*2"
Output: 7
Example 2:
Input: s = " 3/2 "
Output: 1
Example 3:
Input: s = " 3+5 / 2 "
Output: 5
 
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consists of integers and operators ('+', '-', '*', '/') separated by some number of spaces.
s represents a valid expression.
All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range [0, 231 - 1].
The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
```

### Solution that works for Basic Calculator II:

```python
class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        st = []
        num = 0
        sign = "+"

        def update(num, sign):
            if sign == "+":
                st.append(num)
            elif sign == "-":
                st.append(-num)
            elif sign == "*":
                st.append(num * st.pop())
            else:
                # pay attention to this. we are doing it this way because -3//2 will not truncate
                # towards 0. -3//2 is -2 not -1.
                st.append(int(st.pop() / num))

        for c in s:
            if c in "+-/*":
                update(num, sign)
                sign = c
                num = 0
            elif c.isdigit():
                num = num * 10 + int(c)
        update(num, sign)
        return sum(st)

```



### Solution that work for all Basic Calculator problems.

It supports parenthesis too.

```python
class Solution:
   def calculate(self, s):   
       def calc(it):
           def update(op, v):
               if op == "+": stack.append(v)
               if op == "-": stack.append(-v)
               if op == "*": stack.append(stack.pop() * v)
                # pay attention to this. we are doing it this way because -3//2 will not truncate
                # towards 0. -3//2 is -2 not -1.
               if op == "/": stack.append(int(stack.pop() / v))
      
           num, stack, sign = 0, [], "+"
          
           while it < len(s):
               if s[it].isdigit():
                   num = num * 10 + int(s[it])
               elif s[it] in "+-*/":
                   update(sign, num)
                   num, sign = 0, s[it]
               elif s[it] == "(":
                   num, j = calc(it + 1)
                   it = j - 1
               elif s[it] == ")":
                   update(sign, num)
                   return sum(stack), it + 1
               it += 1
           update(sign, num)
           return sum(stack)
       return calc(0)
```

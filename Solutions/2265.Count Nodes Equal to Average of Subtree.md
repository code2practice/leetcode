# [2265. Count Nodes Equal to Average of Subtree](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-nodes-equal-to-average-of-subtree)


## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Given the <code>root</code> of a binary tree, return <em>the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the <strong>average</strong> of the values in its <strong>subtree</strong></em>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The <strong>average</strong> of <code>n</code> elements is the <strong>sum</strong> of the <code>n</code> elements divided by <code>n</code> and <strong>rounded down</strong> to the nearest integer.</li>
	<li>A <strong>subtree</strong> of <code>root</code> is a tree consisting of <code>root</code> and all of its descendants.</li>
</ul>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [4,8,5,0,1,null,6]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
For the node with value 4: The average of its subtree is (4 + 8 + 5 + 0 + 1 + 6) / 6 = 24 / 6 = 4.
For the node with value 5: The average of its subtree is (5 + 6) / 2 = 11 / 2 = 5.
For the node with value 0: The average of its subtree is 0 / 1 = 0.
For the node with value 1: The average of its subtree is 1 / 1 = 1.
For the node with value 6: The average of its subtree is 6 / 1 = 6.

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> For the node with value 1: The average of its subtree is 1 / 1 = 1.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[1, 1000]</code>.</li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 1000</code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: DFS

We design a function $\textit{dfs}$, which calculates the sum and the number of nodes of the subtree rooted at the current node.

The execution process of the function $\textit{dfs}$ is as follows:

-   If the current node is null, return $(0, 0)$.
-   Otherwise, we recursively calculate the sum and the number of nodes of the left and right subtrees, denoted as $(\textit{ls}, \textit{ln})$ and $(\textit{rs}, \textit{rn})$, respectively. Then, the sum $\textit{s}$ and the number of nodes $\textit{n}$ of the subtree rooted at the current node are $\textit{ls} + \textit{rs} + \textit{root.val}$ and $\textit{ln} + \textit{rn} + 1$, respectively. If $\textit{s} / \textit{n} = \textit{root.val}$, it means the current node meets the requirement of the problem, and we increment the answer $\textit{ans}$ by $1$.
-   Finally, the function $\textit{dfs}$ returns $\textit{s}$ and $\textit{n}$.

We initialize the answer $\textit{ans}$ to $0$, then call the $\textit{dfs}$ function, and finally return the answer $\textit{ans}$.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Here, $n$ represents the number of nodes in the binary tree.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def averageOfSubtree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        count = [0]

        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                return (0, 0)
            ls, ln = dfs(root.left)
            rs, rn = dfs(root.right)
            s = ls + rs + root.val
            n = ln + rn + 1
            count[0] += (s) // (n) == root.val
            return (s, n)

        dfs(root)
        return count[0]
```

1017. Convert to Base -2
Medium
Given an integer n, return a binary string representing its representation in base -2.
Note that the returned string should not have leading zeros unless the string is "0".
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: "110"
Explantion: (-2)2 + (-2)1 = 2
Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: "111"
Explantion: (-2)2 + (-2)1 + (-2)0 = 3
Example 3:
Input: n = 4
Output: "100"
Explantion: (-2)2 = 4
 
Constraints:
0 <= n <= 109
```

```python
class Solution:
   def baseNeg2(self, N: int) -> str:
       ans = ""
       while N != 0:
           N, r = divmod(N, -2)
           if r < 0:
               N, r = N + 1, 1
           ans = str(r) + ans
       return max(ans, "0")
```

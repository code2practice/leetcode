# [56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals)


## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Given an array&nbsp;of <code>intervals</code>&nbsp;where <code>intervals[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code>, merge all overlapping intervals, and return <em>an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [[1,5]]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= intervals.length &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>intervals[i].length == 2</code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= start<sub>i</sub> &lt;= end<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
</ul>


```python
class Solution:
   def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
       # Sort the interval list based on the start times of intervals
       intervals.sort()
       # Initialize the merged_intervals list with the first interval
       merged_intervals = [intervals[0]]
       # Iterate over the intervals, starting from the second interval
       for start, end in intervals[1:]:
           # Check if the current interval does not overlap with the last interval in merged_intervals
           if merged_intervals[-1][1] < start:
               # If it does not overlap, add the current interval to merged_intervals
               merged_intervals.append([start, end])
           else:
               # If it does overlap, merge the current interval with the last one by
               # updating the end time of the last interval to the maximum end time seen so far
               merged_intervals[-1][1] = max(merged_intervals[-1][1], end)
       # Return the merged intervals
       return merged_intervals

```


### Time Complexity
The given code has two main operations:  
Sorting the intervals list.  
Iterating through the sorted list and merging overlapping intervals.  
For a list of n intervals:  
The sort operation typically has a complexity of O(n log n), since Python uses TimSort (a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and   
insertion sort) for sorting lists.  
The iteration over the list has a complexity of O(n), because we go through the intervals only once.  
Hence, the total time complexity is the sum of these two operations, which is O(n log n) + O(n). Since O(n log n) is the higher order term,   
it dominates the total time complexity, which simplifies to O(n log n).

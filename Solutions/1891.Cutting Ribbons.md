# [1891. Cutting Ribbons ðŸ”’](https://leetcode.com/problems/cutting-ribbons)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You are given an integer array <code>ribbons</code>, where <code>ribbons[i]</code> represents the length of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> ribbon, and an integer <code>k</code>. You may cut any of the ribbons into any number of segments of <strong>positive integer</strong> lengths, or perform no cuts at all.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a ribbon of length <code>4</code>, you can:</p>
<ul>
    	<li>Keep the ribbon of length <code>4</code>,</li>
    	<li>Cut it into one ribbon of length <code>3</code> and one ribbon of length <code>1</code>,</li>
    	<li>Cut it into two ribbons of length <code>2</code>,</li>
    	<li>Cut it into one ribbon of length <code>2</code> and two ribbons of length <code>1</code>, or</li>
    	<li>Cut it into four ribbons of length <code>1</code>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Your task is to determine the <strong>maximum</strong> length of ribbon, <code>x</code>, that allows you to cut <em>at least</em> <code>k</code> ribbons, each of length <code>x</code>. You can discard any leftover ribbon from the cuts. If it is <strong>impossible</strong> to cut <code>k</code> ribbons of the same length, return 0.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> ribbons = [9,7,5], k = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
- Cut the first ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 5 and one of length 4.
- Cut the second ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 5 and one of length 2.
- Keep the third ribbon as it is.
Now you have 3 ribbons of length 5.</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> ribbons = [7,5,9], k = 4
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
- Cut the first ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 4 and one of length 3.
- Cut the second ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 4 and one of length 1.
- Cut the third ribbon to three ribbons, two of length 4 and one of length 1.
Now you have 4 ribbons of length 4.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> ribbons = [5,7,9], k = 22
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You cannot obtain k ribbons of the same positive integer length.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= ribbons.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= ribbons[i] &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= k &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Binary Search

We observe that if we can obtain $k$ ropes of length $x$, then we can also obtain $k$ ropes of length $x-1$. This implies that there is a monotonicity property, and we can use binary search to find the maximum length $x$ such that we can obtain $k$ ropes of length $x$.

We define the left boundary of the binary search as $left=0$, the right boundary as $right=\max(ribbons)$, and the middle value as $mid=(left+right+1)/2$. We then calculate the number of ropes we can obtain with length $mid$, denoted as $cnt$. If $cnt \geq k$, it means we can obtain $k$ ropes of length $mid$, so we update $left$ to $mid$. Otherwise, we update $right$ to $mid-1$.

Finally, we return $left$ as the maximum length of the ropes we can obtain.

The time complexity is $O(n \times \log M)$, where $n$ and $M$ are the number of ropes and the maximum length of the ropes, respectively. The space complexity is $O(1)$.

#### Python3

```python
def maxLength(ribbons, k: int) -> int:
    left, right = 0, max(ribbons)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right)//2
        if mid == 0:
            return mid
        cnt = sum(x // mid for x in ribbons)
        if cnt >= k:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return left
```

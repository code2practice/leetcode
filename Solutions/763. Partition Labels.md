# [763. Partition Labels](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/)
Medium
```
You are given a string s. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible
so that each letter appears in at most one part.
Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the
parts in order, the resultant string should be s.
Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.
Example 2:
Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"
Output: [10]
 
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of lowercase English letters.
```

### Solution
```
Figure out the rightmost index first and use it to denote the start of the next section.
Reset the left pointer at the start of each new section.
Store the difference of right and left pointers + 1 as in the result for each section.
```

```python
class Solution:
   def partitionLabels(self, s: str) -> List[int]:
       d = {}
       for i in range(len(s)):
           d[s[i]] = i
       m = 0
       prev = -1
       res = []
       for i in range(len(s)):
           m = max(m, d[s[i]])
           if m == i:
               res.append(m - prev)
               prev = m
       return res
```

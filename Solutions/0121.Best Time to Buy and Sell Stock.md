# [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock)


## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You are given an array <code>prices</code> where <code>prices[i]</code> is the price of a given stock on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day.</p>

<p>You want to maximize your profit by choosing a <strong>single day</strong> to buy one stock and choosing a <strong>different day in the future</strong> to sell that stock.</p>

<p>Return <em>the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction</em>. If you cannot achieve any profit, return <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= prices.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= prices[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Enumerate + Maintain the Minimum Value of the Prefix

We can enumerate each element of the array $nums$ as the selling price. Then we need to find a minimum value in front of it as the purchase price to maximize the profit.

Therefore, we use a variable $mi$ to maintain the prefix minimum value of the array $nums$. Then we traverse the array $nums$ and for each element $v$, calculate the difference between it and the minimum value $mi$ in front of it, and update the answer to the maximum of the difference. Then update $mi = min(mi, v)$. Continue to traverse the array $nums$ until the traversal ends.

Finally, return the answer.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array $nums$. The space complexity is $O(1)$.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        ans, mi = 0, inf
        for v in prices:
            ans = max(ans, v - mi)
            mi = min(mi, v)
        return ans
```

## Meta variant
What if you had to return the minimum cost to buy a roundtrip flight?
Note you cannot fly somewhere and back on the same day.

```python
def find_cheapest_tickets(departures, returns):
    min_departure_cost = departures[0]
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    for i in range(1, len(departures)):
        min_cost = min(min_cost, min_departure_cost + returns[i])

        if departures[i] < min_departure_cost:
            min_departure_cost = departures[i]
    
    return min_cost

if __name__ == "__main__":
    departures = [8, 3, 6, 10]
    returns = [10, 9, 5, 8]
    assert find_cheapest_tickets(departures, returns) == 8

    departures = [10, 3, 10, 9, 3]
    returns = [4, 20, 6, 7, 10]
    assert find_cheapest_tickets(departures, returns) == 9

    departures = [1, 3, 10, 9, 3]
    returns = [1, 20, 6, 7, 10]
    assert find_cheapest_tickets(departures, returns) == 7

    departures = [1, 3, 10, 9, 3]
    returns = [1, 1, 6, 7, 10]
    assert find_cheapest_tickets(departures, returns) == 2

    departures = [1, 3, 10, 9, 3]
    returns = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6]
    assert find_cheapest_tickets(departures, returns) == 7

    departures = [12, 33, 44, 9, 23]
    returns = [100, 90, 80, 70, 15]
    assert find_cheapest_tickets(departures, returns) == 24

    departures = [4, 3, 5, 11, 2]
    returns = [1, 6, 10, 2, 9]
    assert find_cheapest_tickets(departures, returns) == 5
```

# [766. Toeplitz Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/toeplitz-matrix)


## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Given an <code>m x n</code> <code>matrix</code>, return&nbsp;<em><code>true</code>&nbsp;if the matrix is Toeplitz. Otherwise, return <code>false</code>.</em></p>

<p>A matrix is <strong>Toeplitz</strong> if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same elements.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,1,2,3],[9,5,1,2]]
<strong>Output:</strong> true
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
In the above grid, the&nbsp;diagonals are:
&quot;[9]&quot;, &quot;[5, 5]&quot;, &quot;[1, 1, 1]&quot;, &quot;[2, 2, 2]&quot;, &quot;[3, 3]&quot;, &quot;[4]&quot;.
In each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.
</pre>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> matrix = [[1,2],[2,2]]
<strong>Output:</strong> false
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The diagonal &quot;[1, 2]&quot; has different elements.

### Solution 1

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def isToeplitzMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        return all(
            matrix[i][j] == matrix[i - 1][j - 1]
            for i in range(1, m)
            for j in range(1, n)
        )
```

### Follow up Important for META
<ul>
	<li>What if the <code>matrix</code> is stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you can only load at most one row of the matrix into the memory at once?</li>
</ul>

```
We can notice that if we shift the previous row to the right it aligns with the next row and we can easily
verify if the value in that column matches the next value in the diagonal.

We also know that the first element in the diagonal should match all other elements in the diagonal
so no there's need to change the value/we can keep re-using that element.

We also know the column that we expect to match our element increments by 1 in every subsequent row
(e.g. we know the value 1 should be at col 0 in row 0, col 1 in row 1, col 2 in row 2 and so on).
That means we just need to slide each value down one col everytime we go to a new row.

The first element (col 0) of every row is the first element of a new diagonal and should be
added to what we're checking for the next row.

Specifically,

At step 0, we set our buffer to expected = [1, 2, 3, 4]
we can skip comparing row 0.
At step 1, we can drop the last element (4) as it has nothing to be compared to anymore.We add 5 to the left of expected as it needs to be compared to elements in the next row.
so expected = [5 1 2 3]
We compare that to row 1, [5 1 2 3] and it checks out.
note: we can start comparing expected to the row from index 1 since we know index 0 is the same.
At step 2, we drop 3 as it has nothing else to be compared to and add 9 to the left of expected.
So expected = [9 5 1 2] and that also checks out.
We're done for this matrix and never saw a mismatch.

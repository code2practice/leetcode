# [134. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station)

[中文文档](/solution/0100-0199/0134.Gas%20Station/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>There are <code>n</code> gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> station is <code>gas[i]</code>.</p>

<p>You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs <code>cost[i]</code> of gas to travel from the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> station to its next <code>(i + 1)<sup>th</sup></code> station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.</p>

<p>Given two integer arrays <code>gas</code> and <code>cost</code>, return <em>the starting gas station&#39;s index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return</em> <code>-1</code>. If there exists a solution, it is <strong>guaranteed</strong> to be <strong>unique</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> -1
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
You can&#39;t start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let&#39;s start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can&#39;t travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>n == gas.length == cost.length</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= gas[i], cost[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(gas)
        i = j = n - 1
        cnt = s = 0
        while cnt < n:
            s += gas[j] - cost[j]
            cnt += 1
            j = (j + 1) % n
            while s < 0 and cnt < n:
                i -= 1
                s += gas[i] - cost[i]
                cnt += 1
        return -1 if s < 0 else i
```

### Solution Optimized O(N):
```
So, our brute-force ran a simulation, as soon as a gas station became -ve. It's stop and move to the next station as a starting point.
But this is inefficient and inorder for us to understand why? we have to look at what makes car stop.
Let's say for this example the car start at 0 and it's able to make at 3 gas station.
And after trying to make it at 4th station its run out of gas.
 
Once the brute force solution realises it can make this trip, it's start over simulating with this gas station as the starting point.
 But this next simulation is useless and wasting time
Here's why,
 Well we already know that these3 gas stations and trips weren't successfull. Which means comparing our fuel accumulation to our fuel consumption we were at some kind of surplus or at the very least we were breaking even with exactly enough fuel to make every trip.
This is because if we were at some kind of deficit then our car would have already run on gas sometime earlier. So, this means on the last trip because we ran out of fuel we were in some kind of deficit.
 So, as we can't make the trip starting at very beginning we can't make over here at index 1 or index 2 or index 3
So what does this means in terms of our algorithm, it means that we know if we run out of fuel say at some ith gas station. All the gas station between ith and starting point are bad starting point as well.
 So, this means we can start trying at next gas station on the i + 1 station. So, hopefully now you understand how this O(N) solution will takes place.
```
```python
class Solution:
   def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
       l = len(gas)
       totalsurplus = 0
       start = 0
       currsurplus = 0
       for i in range(l):
           currsurplus += gas[i] - cost[i]
           totalsurplus += currsurplus
           if currsurplus < 0:
               currsurplus = 0
               start = i + 1
       return start if totalsurplus >= 0 else -1
```
